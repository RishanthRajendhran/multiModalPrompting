The shark appears to not be upset with the situation it's in. uncanny: A shark is only found in the water and will die if it's on land, so seeing one not only on land be being interrogated by a couple of police officers inside of a room is very unusual.

The cops accuse the shark of eating the person on Thursday, and, in defense, the shark retorts that he doesn't remember, and justifies this by saying that it's normal to not recall that type of detail: the cops also probably couldn't remember what they had for lunch a few days ago. The joke is that lunch isn't a small unimportant detail for the shark because they killed someone.", "instance_id": "856aeba4fae684f09ac1ceb56f410b5b", "caption_choices": "Do YOU remember what you had for lunch last Thursday?"}
